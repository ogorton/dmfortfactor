Three interactions in three model spaces:

1) c12ck.dres:  Cohen-Kurath empirical interaction in p-shell 
with fixed alpha core: Cohen and Kurath, NP A73, 1 (1965); NP A101, 1 (1967)

2) No-core shell model (NCSM); Interaction is two-body N3LO chiral interaction, 
Entem & Machleidt PRC 68, 041001(R) (2003), SRG evolved to lambda = 2.0 fm^-1.

Computed with h.o. basis frequency hw = 20 MeV; this is approx min for 
this interaction

in control file set
hofrequency 20.0

Nmax = 6:  c12n3lo_nmax6hw20.dres
Nmax = 8:  c12n3lo_nmax8hw20.dres

3) No-core shell model (NCSM); Interaction is Daejeon16 interaction, 
Shirokov et al, Phys Let B 761, 87 (2016)

Computed with h.o. basis frequency hw = 22.5 MeV; this is approx min for 
this interaction

in control file set
hofrequency 22.5

Nmax = 6:  c12daejeon_nmax6hw22.5.dres
Nmax = 8:  c12daejeon_nmax8hw22.5.dres
